*) in *tex file, fill in the png files without size with/height info
 	\includegraphics{EXAMPLE.png}	
*) run hlatex with utf8 encoding:
	htlatex main.tex "xhtml, charset=utf-8" " -cunihtf -utf8"
	IF ERROR, ARE YOU USING \usepackage{authblk} % for multiple authors with different affiliations ??? this causes problems
*) In the *.html file, 
	*) substitute the *png's with *svg's
	*) add style="text-align:center" to the p element above the img element.
	*) add style="width: 100%; max-width: 800px;" to the img's
	This should center images and make them resize (mobile!)	
*) In the .css files, fill in
	* {
  		font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
	}
	This should remove old-looking serif fonts.
*) Set an alternative HTML document title.
*) Check if citations linebreak (long lists of \citep{}). Insert newlines if not.
*) Check if references linebreak. If long URLs are referenced, this is probably not the case. A hacky solution would be to insert spaces in the displayed URL (the displayed URL is then invalid, but that doesn't affect the href URL, so it still works). For a cleaner solution, consider hiding the full URL in the PDF document, by using

\usepackage[hidelinks]{hyperref}
% Redefinition, symbol included in link:
\let\orighref\href
\renewcommand{\href}[2]{\underline{\orighref{#1}{#2}}}

in the latex document.

*) Set a body style max width suitable for large monitors:
	style="font-size: 100%; width=100%; max-width: 800px; padding: 1em; margin: auto;"
*) As suggested by http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_viewport.asp , do 
	<meta name=viewport content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

MANUAL MODIFICATIONS
*) Umlauts in \emph{} blocks cause spaces within a word. Attempt to fix in the final section of "main.py". In any case, check the final HTML file manually for errors. The problem is caused by a combination of htlatex and the BeautifulSoup default formatter.
*) Set alternative <h?> titles
